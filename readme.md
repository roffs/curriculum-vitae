## ABOUT ME

I'm a software engineer, passionate about software development and always eager to learn new stuff. I love figuring out how things work, both on the surface and behind the scenes. Right now, I'm really into graphics programming and the rust programming language.

Beyond my technical interests, I see myself as someone who's easy to approach and aims to create an  atmosphere where everyone feels safe and comfortable. I believe in teamwork and enjoy collaborating with people from different backgrounds to learn and create together.
